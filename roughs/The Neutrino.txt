The Neutrino
Efficient Management and coordination between various clubs and groups in IIT(ISM).


The main motivation in developing this application would be to streamline the functioning
of various student run organisations, clubs, NGO's in ISM. We envision a platform that would
enable a student to gain all the information about the various activities going on around the campus.
Clubs will be able to maintain a database of all their members. The students will be able keep track 
of upcoming meetings without any confusion.This app will also aim to make the process of organising various
fests and events in campus much easier.Students will get relevant notifications regarding these events on 
their mobile devices(no more posters on water coolers).They will also be able to register for activities 
from within the app (no more google docs !!).


Some Features:  (Guaranteed)
1. Relevant information regarding the clubs.
2. Easy Registration for various clubs/activities.
3. Advertisements regarding Blood Donation Camps, Workshops and yes... T-shirts.


Our team has a lot more cool ideas that we would want to implement in this application, and we
would strive to achieve them. But due to shortcomings in our technical knowledge and time constraint,
maybe we will not be able to showcase them. We accept that. We believe that it is time that we solve 
our many problems through the use of technology. That is our goal. And this app will our first step.
